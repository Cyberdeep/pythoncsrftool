pythoncsrftool
==============

A csrf tool written in python to test for CSRF vulnerabilities in web apps.
It reads from a txt file the differents requests (GET and POST) and execute
them saving the output to a folder.

I record requests using LiveHttpHeaders that is
a great Firefox plugin https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/live-http-headers/
and also use a great python tool for requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
